    <h2>Teaching Experience<span class="date-right">2021 - Present</span></h2>
        <p> My teaching experience has made me proficient in active listening and
        communication. I enjoy teaching and focus on improving my teaching skills over time. I am strongly influenced by teaching style of Prof. Richard P. Feynman; by watching his lectures on the character of physical laws given to a general audience, to the way he used to explain
        complicated physical concepts in an easy way. I love doing research and the reward I get for teaching physics to other students has been very satisfying.</p>

    <h4>Teaching Assistant - Introductory Physics Lab II for Biological Sciences<span class="date-right">| University of California, Merced, CA (Jan 2024 - Present)</span></h4>
    <h4>Teaching Assistant - Introductory Physics Lab I for Biological Sciences<span class="date-right">| University of California, Merced, CA (Jan 2023 - Dec 2023)</span></h4>
    <h4>Teaching Assistant - Introductory Physics Discussions<span class="date-right">| University of California,
        Merced, CA (Aug 2022 - Dec 2022)</span></h4>

    <p> My work include developing and implementing effective teaching strategies for the Introductory Physics Lab, specifically tailored
        for students in biological sciences. My role involves close collaboration with faculty and other teaching
        assistants to create laboratory exercises that are not only educational but also engaging. I am committed
        to fostering an environment that supports and motivates students, particularly those from non-physics
        backgrounds. My approach in the classroom is driven by a deep passion for teaching and making physics
        accessible and enjoyable for all students</p>

    <h4> Teaching Associate - Fundamentals of Physics Lab<span class="date-right">|San Jose State University (SJSU), San Jose, CA (Jan 2021 - May 2022)</span></h4>
    <p>I also worked as a Teaching Associate in the department of Physics and Astronomy at SJSU where I was a part of
        a team of instructors all teaching the same course to their sections. It was an introductory, algebra based physics Lab course where
        we used a reformed model-based curriculum which emphasizes that students explicitly explain their reasoning.
        This is a novel pedagogical approach in teaching physics.</p>

    <h2> Research Experience <span class="date-right">2020 - Present</span></h2>
        <p>Although my official appointments often alternated between Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant roles,
        my engagement in research has been continuous since 2020. As a graduate student, my research journey has been
        marked by successful project completions and a notable publication as a result
        of my Master's research work. I have worked to blend theoretical knowledge with practical applications, always
        aiming to contribute meaningfully to the field of Physics. My experiences have not only enhanced
        my research skills in physics but also enriched my understanding in fields which are outside of physics domain such
            as web application design, and data analysis.</p>
        <h4> Graduate Student Researcher<span class="date-right">| University of California, Merced (May 2023 - August 2023)</span></h4>
        <p>In this role I started my research on Quantum Rabi Array, which is my current research project in PhD</p>
        <h4> Instructional Student Assistant Researcher<span class="date-right">| San Jose State University (SJSU), CA (June 2021 - Dec 2021)</span></h4>
        <p>In this role I started my project on 2D Spin Torque Oscillator Arrays (see full description in All Projects and Research section)</p>
