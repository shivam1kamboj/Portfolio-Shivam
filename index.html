        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a dedicated PhD Physics scholar at the University of 
California, Merced, my focus is on Quantum Computing and Computational 
Physics. I have a strong background in Physics with a Master's degree from 
San Jose State University and Chandigarh University.</p>

        <h2>Current Research</h2>
        <p>As a doctoral student I am working with Prof. Lin Tian in the field of Quantum Computing, specifically exploring the "Quantum Rabi Array".
            My research aim to revolutionize quantum computing hardware by advancing techniques to mitigate errors and address the critical challenge
            of decoherence. Our work not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of quantum systems but
            also paves the way for practical applications in next-generation quantum technologies  Quantum simulation
            of molecule docking to study protein folding, developing strategies for High-Frequency Trading, and enhancing
            Market Prediction and Trend Analysis.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Rabi Array Simulation Interface</h2>
    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        Developed an interactive web interface for the simulation and analysis of a two-site Quantum Rabi Array (QRA),
        a cornerstone in my PhD research in Quantum Computing. This comprehensive tool facilitates the exploration of
        quantum cavity interactions and photon exchange dynamics, crucial for advancing quantum computational models.
        The web interface is not available for public and kept private to keep the unpublished results safe.
    </p>
